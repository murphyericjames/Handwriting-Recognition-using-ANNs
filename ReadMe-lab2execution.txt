The language used in this assignment is R using the h2o library, which was written in a jupyter notebook distributed with Anaconda.

The results can best be obtained by executing the jupyter notebook in jupyter: Lab2.
Each cell contains a different result presented in the assignment.  These can be executed by pushing the run button.

For ease of use these have also been saved as .r files below, which I do not know how to run currently from terminal.
The .r files require no inputs, are not coupled, and are as follows:

File to inspect best number of hidden layers and units for tanh activation and Cross-Entropy Loss
CrossEntTanh_varHidden.r

File to inspect best number of hidden layers and units for tanh activation and Quadratic Loss
QuadTanh_varHidden.r

File to inspect best momentum and learning rates for tanh activation and Cross-Entropy Loss
CrossEntTanh_varRates.r

File to inspect best momentum and learning rates for tanh activation and Quadratic Loss
QuadTanh_varRates.r

File to inspect best momentum and learning rates for ReLU activation and Cross-Entropy Loss
CrossEntReLU_varRates.r

File to make comparison between all 3 final models
FinalModelCompare.r

File to produce plot for the power law fit, for the tanh with Cross-Entropy loss case
PowerlawFit.r

File to produce the accuracies for scaled vs. non-scaled input
InputScale.r
